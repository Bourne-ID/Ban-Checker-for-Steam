# Ban-Checker-for-Steam-Enhanced

Chrome extension to track and analysed previous players who you have played with to check for recent bans, notifying you when one of those players are banned. Will track the recently played screen to provide more than the Steam's 14 day recently played history.

This is based on MrHayato's script, and walk3's Chrome Extension. 

Script works on pages with URIs that follow such patterns:
- \*://steamcommunity.com/id/\*/friends\*
- \*://steamcommunity.com/profiles/\*/friends\*

Remove all reference to API keys and using Google App Cloud for calls, therefore hiding all keys but keeping the 'click and go' usability available.

## Privacy Policy
Data submitted using this app will be sent to a Google Cloud Application for fast cache returns and ease of use. Please see the [Cloud App Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Bourne-ID/Steam-Ban-Cloud-Check/blob/master/README.md) for information on data stored in the cloud.

**No data is stored in the Chrome Extension**
